# My webCV

Welcome to my project, a personal web-based CV. Here you can learn more about me and my experiences. I created this for me to practice and improve my coding skills, as well as learn new ones. Most importantly I have made this to have fun and being creative with coding. All illustrations and photos featured are my own work.

Please note, this is still a work in progress, and Iâ€™m continuously adding new features and improvements. I hope you enjoy exploring it!

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Vite: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- CSS Modules: A CSS file in which all class and animation names are scoped locally by default.

## Testing

I plan on adding tests to this project soon. Tests will ensure that all components function correctly and that any future updates won't break the existing functionality.

Once test are written, they are ran with the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```


## To lint your code, run:

```sh
npm run lint

## Use Prettier
